4000 kw Solar Ground Mounted Power Project By M/s Devnandan Renewable Energy Pvt. Ltd (Devnadan SSDSP project)

This is a project activity of capacity 4000 kw, which is Solar Ground Mounted grid connected solar
power generation project in the District Patan, in the state of Gujarat, in India. The purpose of this
plant installation and power generation is for sale to Govt and Power Purchase agreement is signed
between the Project owner and Uttar Gujarat Vij Company Limited (UGVCL). The promoter of the
project activity is ‘M/s Devnandan Renewable Energy Pvt. Ltd’ (herein after called as Project
Proponent or PP). PP has the full ownership of the project activity. This project is an operational
activity with continuous reduction of GHG, currently being applied under “Universal Carbon
Registry” (UCR). 

As per the ex-ante estimate, this project will generate approximately 7000 MWh of electricity per
annum considering an average PLF of 20%. The project activity uses Poly Crystalline solar
photovoltaic technology to generate clean energy. The generation of power from solar photovoltaic
is a clean technology as there is no fossil fuel fired or no GHG gases are emitted during the process.
Photovoltaic module consists of several photovoltaic cells connected by circuits and sealed in an
environmentally protective laminate, which forms the fundamental building blocks of the complete
PV generating unit. Several PV panels mounted on a frame are termed as PV Array. Thus, project
activity leads to reduce the GHG emissions as it displaces power from fossil fuel-based electricity
generation in the regional grid.
